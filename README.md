This repository contains the code and data use in [Accessing Numerical Energy Hessians with Graph Neural Network Potentials and Their Application in Heterogeneous Catalysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01650)

The data has been saved in ase.db files and may be found in the dataset folder
The implementation of complete potential energy sampling as well as supporting analysis code can be found in the utils folder.

Reach out to any of the authors if you have questions! :)
